Inspired by Spotle, a Wordle remake with pop artists instead of words, this project utilizes object oriented programming to create an immersive graphical user interface that seamlessly interacts with an ArrayList database. The idea for the program arose from my genuine interest in music trivia. This ambitious Internal Assessment allowed me to fully excercise my Java programming knowledge and explore alternative solutions to overcome complex obstacles.
